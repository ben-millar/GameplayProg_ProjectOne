This project was created for my **Gameplay Programming** module in 2nd year of Computer Games Development at IT Carlow.

The goal of this project was to show an ability to instantiate a textured object multiple times in OpenGL, as well has handling collisions with these objects. With regard to gameplay, this project was to emulate the gameplay shown in [THIS](https://gamemechanicexplorer.com/#lightning-5) example from *Game Mechanic Explorer*.

In all, I'm very happy with how this project turned out; I think simple additions like audio and screenshake really did a lot to sell the 'feel' of this game. 

I plan to add a video demo **HERE** shortly.
